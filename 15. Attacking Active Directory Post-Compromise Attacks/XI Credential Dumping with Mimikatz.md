# XI. Credential Dumping with Mimikatz.

Make sure the Windows machine is on and logged in as a local user.

Get mimikatz [here](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz).

Git clone into directory of choice in Kali. We need these files that are found in the `x64` directory.

Start a python server in kali with `python3 -m http.server`

On Windows go to the browser and type in the Kali IP address.

We should have access to our Kali directories, click on the following files to download them.

The files should now be in the Downloads folder.

Open the command-line as administrator.

Move to the downloads folder and run mimikatz and set privilege mode to debug.

Now we can run attacks.

Use the `sekurlsa::` command to list out the attacks.

Letâ€™s try to list all available account credentials on the machine using `sekurlsa::logonPasswords`.

This will return the NTLM hashes and plaintext password of the users and local admins.
