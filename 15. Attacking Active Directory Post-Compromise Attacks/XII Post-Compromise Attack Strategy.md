# XII. Post-Compromise Attack Strategy

- We have an account, now what?
- Search for quick wins
    - Kerberoasting
    - Secretsdump
    - Pass the hash / pass the password
- No quick wins? Time to dig deep
    - Enumerate (Bloodhound, Plumhound etc.)
    - What does the account have access to? (File shares, sensitive files, credential reuse on other accounts)
    - Old vulnerabilities
