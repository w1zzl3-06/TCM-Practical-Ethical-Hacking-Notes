# Google Fu

Google Dorking, also known as Google hacking, is the use of advanced search operators and techniques to refine and narrow down online searches on the Google search engine.

Here are a few examples:

| Dork | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| site:example.com | Restricts search results to a specific domain (replace "example.com" with the target). |
| filetype:pdf site:example.com | Searches for PDF files within a specific domain. |
| intitle:"index of" site:example.com | Searches for directories and indexes within a specific domain. |
| inurl:admin site:example.com | Searches for URLs containing "admin" within a specific domain. |
| intext:username filetype:sql | Searches for SQL files containing the term "username." |
| ext:log site:example.com | Searches for log files within a specific domain. |
| filetype:conf site:example.com | Searches for configuration files within a specific domain. |
| inurl:/wp-content/uploads/ site:example.com | Searches for WordPress uploads within a specific domain. |
