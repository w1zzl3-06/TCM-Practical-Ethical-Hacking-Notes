# 8. Scanning with Nessus

## What is Nessus?

Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanning tool that helps identify security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses in computer systems and networks.

Make sure the download corresponds to the OS that you intend to install Nessus on. In this case, “Linux - Debain - amd64” for Kali.

## Installation

Open the terminal:

- `cd Download``
- `dpkg -i Nessus-10.6.4-debian10_amd64.deb`
- Once Nessus is installed, start it up through the terminal using `/bin/systemctl start nessusd.service`  and going to [`https://kali:8834/`](https://kali:8834/) on the browser.
- Nessus will give the option for either an offline or online registration. But for the sake of this course, we’ll go for the online version.
- Select Register for Nessus Essentials and provide a valid email address to receive an activation code.
- After that, create a username and password then wait for the plugins to finish downloading (might take a while).
- Enter the credentials from the previous step and we should have access to the Dashboard.

## Setting up a scan

We can now start setting up a scan for our target machine (Kioptrix) by clicking on the `New Scan` button on the top-right corner of the dashboard, which will take us to the Scan Templates page:

- Under the `Vulnerabilities` section, select `Basic Network Scan`
- In the settings tab, give the scan any name & description. Then make sure to set the Kioptrix IP address as the target.
- Next under the Settings tab in the `Discovery` section. Set the scan type to and set it to `Port scan (All ports)`
- In the `Assessment` section. Set the scan type to `Scan for known web vulnerabilities`
- Click on  `Save`

## Exploring the Scan:

- In the `My Scans` click on `Launch` to start the scan.
- The scan should return some results after a while. Feel free to go through the results one by one to see what you can find. You can group the results based on severity as shown below:

- Clicking on any result will provide a lot of useful information including the description, solution as well as various references.
