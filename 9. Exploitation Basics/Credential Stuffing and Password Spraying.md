# Credential Stuffing and Password Spraying

## What is Credential Stuffing?

Automated attack using breached account credentials to gain unauthorized access. Typically, the attackers leverage the fact that many people reuse passwords across multiple sites and services. By automating the login process with these stolen credentials, attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts on a large scale.

## What is Password Spraying?

Password spraying is a type of cyberattack where an attacker systematically attempts a few commonly used passwords against many usernames or accounts. Instead of attempting numerous passwords against a single account (as in a brute force attack), password spraying involves trying a limited set of passwords across a large number of accounts. This technique helps attackers avoid account lockouts and detection mechanisms that may be triggered by repeated failed login attempts.

## Differences between Password Spraying and Credential Stuffing.

| Feature | Password Spraying | Credential Stuffing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Objective | Gain unauthorized access by trying a few commonly used passwords across many accounts | Gain unauthorized access by using a large set of username and password pairs obtained from previous breaches |
| Attack Strategy | Systematic attempts with a limited set of passwords across a large number of usernames or accounts | Automated login attempts using a large set of known username and password pairs across multiple platforms |
| Password Usage | Relies on easily guessable or commonly used passwords, such as "123456" or "password" | Utilizes stolen username and password pairs from previous data breaches or leaks |
| Stealthiness | Designed to be stealthy, with a low and slow approach to avoid detection | May involve a higher volume of login attempts but distributed across a large number of accounts |
| Account Lockouts | Attempts to avoid triggering account lockouts by using a few attempts per account | May lead to account lockouts due to multiple login attempts for individual accounts |
| Detection Challenges | Detecting password spraying can be challenging as it involves a low number of attempts per account | Easier to detect due to a higher volume of login attempts, but sophisticated attackers may still try to remain stealthy |
| Prevention Measures | Organizations can implement account lockout policies, rate limiting, and multi-factor authentication | Multi-factor authentication, monitoring for unusual login patterns, and blocking known malicious IP addresses can help prevent credential stuffing |
| Example Attack Scenario | Trying a small set of passwords (e.g., "password1") against a large number of email accounts | Using a list of username and password pairs obtained from a previous breach to gain unauthorized access to various online services |
| Commonly Targeted Platforms | Web applications, email services, online platforms with weak or commonly reused passwords | Various online services and platforms with users who may reuse passwords across multiple accounts |

## Mitigations

- Encourage or enforce strong, unique passwords for each account. Discourage the use of easily guessable passwords or password patterns.
- Implement account lockout policies to temporarily lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts. This prevents attackers from repeatedly trying passwords for a single account.
- Enforce multi-factor authentication to add an additional layer of security. Even if passwords are compromised, MFA can significantly enhance account protection.
- Utilize web application firewalls that can detect and block automated attacks, including credential stuffing attempts.
- Regularly monitor the dark web for the sale or distribution of compromised credentials associated with your organization.
- Continuously monitor login activities and set up alerts for suspicious patterns, such as multiple failed login attempts from different IP addresses.
