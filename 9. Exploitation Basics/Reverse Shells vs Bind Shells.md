# Reverse Shells vs Bind Shells

Reverse shells and bind shells are two types of shell connections used in the context of network security, penetration testing, and exploitation. They refer to the direction of the connection establishment between the attacker's machine and the target machine.

**Reverse Shell:**

- In a reverse shell scenario, the target system initiates a connection back to the attacker's machine. The attacker typically sets up a listener on their machine to receive the connection. Once the connection is established, the attacker gains command-line access to the target system. Reverse shells are useful in situations where the target is behind a firewall or Network Address Translation (NAT) device.

**Bind Shell:**

- In a bind shell scenario, the attacker sets up a listening service on the target machine, and the attacker connects to it. The target system listens on a specific port for incoming connections, and once a connection is established, the attacker gains access to the command shell on the target. Bind shells are useful when the target system has a publicly accessible IP address or when there are no firewall restrictions.
- Example using Netcat:

In summary:

- **Reverse Shell:** Target connects back to the attacker.
- **Bind Shell:** Attacker connects to a listening service on the target.
