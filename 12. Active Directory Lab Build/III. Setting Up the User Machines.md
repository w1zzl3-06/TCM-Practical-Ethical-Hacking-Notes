# iii. Setting Up the User Machines

First make sure our DC machine has been turned off, this is to free up memory.

Next, the initial setup steps are identical, the only difference is we’re going to use the Windows Enterprise ISO file instead.

Eventually, we’ll reach this step:

Make sure to click on `Domain join instead`

After that, create a user name , a memorable password, and some security questions.

Turn off everything here, just in case and click `Accept`. 

Finally make sure to change the PC name and install the VBoxGuestAdditions package.

NOTE: If there’s enough space and memory, we can set up another user machine exactly the same way using the same ISO file. If not, one user machine is okay.
